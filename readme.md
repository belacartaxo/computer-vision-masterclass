# Computer Vision Masterclass
This repository was created to document my progress in the [Computer Vision Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-vision-masterclass/) course. Here, I will share notes, projects, code, and insights I gain throughout the learning journey. If you're also studying or interested in Computer Vision, feel free to follow along and share suggestions or feedback. ðŸ˜Š

## Course Objectives
This course provides a complete immersion into Computer Vision, covering foundational concepts, advanced techniques, and practical implementations with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and more.

### What Iâ€™m learning:
- Object and Face Detection:
    - Detect faces and objects such as cars, clocks, and people using OpenCV and Dlib.
    - Compare detection methods: Haarcascade, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).
    - Use the LBPH algorithm to perform facial recognition in images and via webcam.

- Object Tracking
    - Apply algorithms like KCF and CSRT to track objects in videos.

- Neural Networks
    - Understand the theory behind dense neural networks (perceptron, activation functions, backpropagation, etc.).
    - Build dense and convolutional neural networks to classify images.
    - Apply transfer learning and fine-tuning to improve classification results.

- Advanced Techniques
    - Detect emotions in images and videos.
    - Compress images using autoencoders.
    - Implement image segmentation to extract useful information.
    - Detect objects in images and videos using YOLO.
    - Create images using GANs, Deep Dream, and style transfer techniques.
